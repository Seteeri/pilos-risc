Differences between PilOS and Pil21

The goal is to retain the core functionality and paradigm as much as possible:
* data types
* memory management/gc
* evaluation
* coroutines
* error handling (see debug for changes)
* db

Because pilOS runs bare metal and does not use the conventional UNIX/C file metaphor, much of the conventional OS related functionality is either removed or replaced with something similar.

For unspecified symbols, functionality remains the same.
